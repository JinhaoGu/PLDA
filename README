=== A simple library to run LDA ===
With this library LDA can be run. The library provides overall just two simple methods to estimate
and predict an LDA classifier.

=== Installation ===

Make sure you have the variable KALDI_ROOT set in your path.
Otherwise:

export KALDI_ROOT=/YOUTPATH/TO/KALDI/ROOT

then just build the libraries:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make

The installation process compiles a shared library and drops it into the local users python path.

To use it, please just write any python script:

import liblda

lda = liblda.LDA()

#Estimate an LDA model
lda.fit(spktoutts,targetdim)


transformedutt = lda.fit(pathtoutt)

Make sure that spktoutts is a dict where the keys represent the speaker model and the values
represent all the utterances belonging to that speaker. Therefore it is a dict with strings
as keys and a list as values.
